# CandyPanda-Game

A game developed in Greenfoot framework in Java constitutes an object collecting candies which are randomly moving on the frame. 
#Some of the features are
decrease in timer as level increases, cool visual and audio effects, bonus and implementation of Gang of Four design patterns for diferent function which makes the framework more neat and efficient.

The panda has to collect maximum candies within a specified time. As level increases, the timer decreases and speed of the moving candies  increases. The panda dies if it collects poison.
The project was used using Agile methodology where Scrum task boards, burndown charts for tracking the project schedule progress and XP values were used.


#Design Patterns used are

1.Observer Pattern for updating scores and displaying appropriate messages based on the scores.
2. State Pattern for level implementation
3. Abstract Factory Pattern for generating candies and poison that move in random trajectories on screen
4. Command Pattern for bonus collection.
